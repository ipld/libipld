//! Store traits.
//!
//! ## Aliases
//! An alias is a named root of a dag. When a root is aliased, none of the leaves of the dag
//! pointed to by the root will be collected by gc. However, a root being aliased does not
//! mean that the dag must be complete.
//!
//! ## Temporary pin
//! A temporary pin is an unnamed set of roots of a dag, that is just for the purpose of protecting
//! blocks from gc while a large tree is constructed. While an alias maps a single name to a
//! single root, a temporary alias can be assigned to an arbitrary number of blocks before the
//! dag is finished.
//!
//! ## Garbage collection (GC)
//! GC refers to the process of removing unaliased blocks. When it runs is implementation defined.
//! However it is intended to run only when the configured size is exceeded at when it will start
//! incrementally deleting unaliased blocks until the size target is no longer exceeded. It is
//! implementation defined in which order unaliased blocks get removed.
